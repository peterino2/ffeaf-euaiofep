Note. Emberlight is a turn based party based combat system meant to fulfill
typical party combat mechanics in a high fantasy setting.

as far as the board game goes, each game of emberlight involves one or more 
players controlling the actions of all the player characters in the party.

The game is played out on a grid system representing the battlefield.

Victory is achieved when all enemies are defeated.

The game is played with players of the party fighting against a game master. 

OR 

The game can be played in an adversarial Player-vs-player mode.


Turn sequence:

during a players turn the following happens

- All characters on your team gain 6 AP and 4 Mana up to a maximum of 6 AP and 6 Mana
- Player chooses a character to 'activate'
    - The player draws 4 cards from that character's Ability Deck
    - the character can perform the following actions as many times as they are able to and in any order.:
        - move; spending 1 ap for each square they move
        - basic attack; deal 2 damage at the cost of 2 ap
        - defend; gain 2 block at the cost of 2 ap
        - activate character feature; pay the cost and activate their class feature.
        - play a card; activate the effect of a card in the hand by paying the cost associated with the card, and moving it to that character's discard pile.
    - When no more actions can be taken or until the player chooses.
    - the character's turn ends. All cards in the hand are added to that character's discard pile.
    - the player then repeats this step until all characters have been activated.
    - the next player/monsters then take their turn.
- when a character's hp hits zero, they are removed from the board.
- The game ends when one team is completely wiped out.
